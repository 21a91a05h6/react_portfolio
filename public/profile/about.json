    "about": " Hello everyone I'm **Polisetti Sri Divya Prabha**. I'm a **Full Stack Developer**. I completed my B.Tech from **Aditya Engineering College, Surampalem** with specialization of **Computer Science Engineering.**\n\n\nI really enjoy making responsive websites, because they throw challenges at us, and obviously I love solving them.\nIf I were to ever come across a super responsive yet user understandable and simple website I will really be very happy, I want my friends, my family to feel the same about the websites or applications that they are using, this gives me a constant motivation as of to why I have to pursue my dream job as a Full Stack Developer. Other than this I really enjoy drawing, playing badminton, listening to music, or go for a long walk because why not as people say a healthy and stress free brain always gives great ideas, and these ideas become the foundation of the websites that I create.",
